    <h1>Interactive Programming 1 Project 1 - Status Update #2</h1>
    
    <p>Since the last status update: <br />

        <ul>
            <li>•	I have rectified the referencing issue</li>
            <li>•	I have partially completed task 3.1.1 (outstanding: "turn" frames)</li>
            <li>•	I have completed tasks 4.1 (i) and partially completed tasks 4.1 (iv) and (v)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>While I have not had any problems completing most items listed above, I have struggled with the implementation of multi-key controls. As far as I can figure out, custom classes will have to be used and I am unsure as to how to use them. 
    </p> 

    <p>I am currently redrawing the parallax scrolling background, as previous attempts to integrate the background to Flash via Illustrator have yielded unsatisfactory results. 
    </p>

    <p>I have also quickly implemented one trial instance of the collision detection element. I have yet to resolve the looping operation of the event but I will rectify this using Boolean variables, similar to what I have used for the left and right-key walk cycle keyboard event action. 
    </p>

    <p>Having reviewed the marks breakdown, I have opted to try all of the bonus mark criteria items, as they do not appear beyond my ability.
    </p>

    <p>Lastly, I have had difficulties with using GitHub within the college. When I attempt to clone my repository, the client tells me that it “does not exist”, despite the fact that I am using on a regular basis on my laptop.
