        <p class="measure lh-copy">

        <ul>

          <li>In 2015 we paid 25% loan interest rebate which meant that our members received one quarter of all interest paid back into their savings. This was the highest rebate ever paid by Cahir Credit Union and was very well received by our members</li>

          <li>We encourage you to manage your money by structuring the loan around your needs and ability to repay</li>

          <li>Ease of payment — you can phone our office with your debit card details and pay up to a max of €500 to your savings or loan</li>

          <li>We offer you the facility to pay your loan by Standing Order</li>

          <li>No penalties are charged on early repayment of loans. If you want, you can pay more than the agreed repayment amount and you will clear the loan faster!</li>

          <li>Loans operate on a reducing balance so as your loan reduces so does the interest</li>

          <li>Credit Union Interest rates are fair and reasonable and capped by Law</li>

          <li>Loan interest rebates are paid where possible which further reduces the cost of the loan</li>

          <li>Your Credit Union loan is insured (subject to terms and conditions) at no extra cost to the member with Loan Protection Insurance</li>

          <li>Your savings are protected under the Government's Deposit Protection Scheme up to a maximum of €100,000 per member</li>

          <li>Your Credit Union is a "not for profit" financial cooperative where all surpluses are paid back to members</li>

          <li>We've served this community for over forty years</li>

        </ul>

        </p>

        <p class="measure lh-copy">&nbsp;</p>

        <h1 class="f4 f3-ns semibold ttn lh-solid ptxl" id="apply">How to Apply</h1>

        <p class="measure lh-copy">To apply for your first loan you must establish a savings record for at least ten weeks and have made a lodgement each week for that period.

        </p>

        <p class="measure lh-copy">&nbsp;</p>

        <h1 class="f4 f3-ns semibold ttn lh-solid">Loan Application Stages</h1>

        <p class="measure lh-copy">

        <ol>

          <li>Complete Loan Application Form</li>

          <li>Member to provide relevant documentation i.e. proof of income and bank statements</li>

          <li>Credit Committee will consider and decide on loan applications weekly on a Monday night</li>

          <li>The decision will be communicated to the member the following day</li>

        </ol>

        </p>

        <p class="measure lh-copy">

          The Credit Union deems it appropriate and prudent to have a robust procedure for reviewing loan applications. This is driven by three main objectives: protecting our members' savings, protect individual members from over-borrowing and to adhere to stricter regulatory guidelines.

        </p>

        <p class="measure lh-copy">

          The primary consideration in reviewing an application is the member's ability to repay the loan for the duration of the term loan. Due to the volatile and unguaranteed nature of some income, overtime, temporary allowances and rental income from property or commericial interests, we need to carefully access all information provided.

        </p>

        <p class="measure lh-copy">

          However, this income can be used by the memeber to make lump-sum repayments on the loan if they choose to do so. The type of income that is considered in relation to ability to repay the loan is the guaranteed income of the member (and that of their spouse/partner if applicable).

        </p>

        <p class="measure lh-copy">There are three different ways to make your loan application:

        <ol>

          <li>Call into the office during opening hours and make your loan application (Note that we close on Thursdays but open until 1pm on a Saturday)</li>

          <li>Make your application over the phone (052 74 41843)</li>

          <li>Email <span class="underline">info@cahircu.ie</span> with loan amount, purpose, desired repayment and contact number. We will do a call back and talk you through the application and process.</li>

        </ol>

        </p>

        <p><b>Example of Cost of Credit:</b> <br />

          A secured loan of €1,000, paid over one year, will have an initial weekly repayment including interest of €20.77 which will reduce as your loan decreases. With APR unchanged the total cost of credit for this loan is €40.64. The total repaid by the member would be €1,040.64.
