            <p class="measure lh-copy">
                <b>Income Tax/DIRT</b> <br />

             Financial service providers such as Credit Unions, banks, building societies and post offices, offer accounts where you can save a sum of money (a deposit) for which they will pay you an annual rate of interest in return, usually as a percentage of the deposit. The interest you receive is subject to a tax called Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT). The current rate is 41%.

            </p>

            <p class="measure lh-copy">

               Since 1 January 2014 all credit union share dividend and deposit interest paid to members is subject to DIRT, with the exception of dividend or interest paid to members who are exempt from DIRT (certain people over aged 65 and certain people who are permanently incapacitated). This is explained below.

            </p>

            <p class="measure lh-copy">

               DIRT does not apply to interest on deposits owned by: Companies that are liable to corporation tax, Charities, People not resident for tax in Ireland (see also below) and Revenue-approved pension schemes.

            </p>            

       <p class="measure lh-copy">

               <b>Exemptions and refunds</b> <br />
           Certain people may qualify for a refund of DIRT or may have their deposit interest paid without the deduction of DIRT. You must apply to have your deposit interest paid without the deduction of DIRT - see 'Where to apply' below.

            </p>

            <p class="measure lh-copy">
                
                <ul>

                <li> <u>People aged over 65</u>: You can get your deposit interest paid without the deduction of DIRT or you can claim a DIRT refund, if you are over 65 and:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your income (including your spouse or civil partner's income) is less than the low income exemption limits for people aged over 65 (<a class="blue" href="http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/money_and_tax/tax/income_tax_credits_and_reliefs/older_peoples_tax_credits_and_reliefs.html" target="_blank">more info &raquo;</a>) </li>
                        or
                        <li>Your tax liability (including your spouse or civil partner's income) for the year is less than your tax credits (including your spouse's) for that year.</li>

                </li>

            </ul>    
    </p>
            <p class="measure lh-copy">In general, joint accounts where one of the account holders is aged 65 or over will only qualify for the refund of DIRT if the other account holder is that person’s spouse or civil partner. </p>
            <p class="measure lh-copy">However, if another person, such as your son or daughter, has the authority to operate your bank account on your behalf, and is named as an account holder for this purpose only, you will continue to qualify for the refund of DIRT provided you are the beneficial owner of the account. </p>
            <p class="measure lh-copy">In this case, when claiming a refund of DIRT, you must include a declaration that you (not your child) are entitled to all of the interest paid in respect of the deposit.
</p>

            <p class="measure lh-copy">
                
                <ul>

                <li> <u>People with disabilities</u>: You can get your deposit interest paid without the deduction of DIRT or a DIRT refund, if you are:

                        <li>Permanently incapacitated from maintaining yourself  </li>

<u>First Time Buyers</u>: First time buyers who buy or self-build a house or apartment to live in as their home may be able to claim a refund of the DIRT paid on their savings.   
    </p>
            <p class="measure lh-copy">
If you buy or self-build a property between 14 October 2014 and 31 December 2017 you may be entitled to claim a refund of DIRT. You must be a first-time buyer. This means that you have never, either individually or jointly with any other person, previously purchased or built a house or apartment. The property must be purchased or built as your home. The relief does not include properties acquired for investment purposes. 
</p>
            <p class="measure lh-copy">You can claim a refund of any DIRT deducted from interest earned on savings used for the purchase of a property or a self-build in the 48 months prior to the purchase date (date of conveyance). 
</p>
            <p class="measure lh-copy">You can only claim relief on DIRT paid on savings up to a maximum of 20% of the purchase price or in the case of self-builds, 20% of the completion value of the property.

                <b>Taxation on deposit accounts</b> <br />
                
                In the case of savings held in deposit accounts the credit union must deduct D.I.R.T. from any interest payable to members. The credit union member receives the net interest after the deduction of the tax. This deduction fully discharges the members' income tax liability in respect of the interest received. The credit union makes a gross return to the Revenue Commissioners.
</p>

<p class="measure lh-copy">
                <b>Certificates of Interest</b> <br />
                
               Any member may request a certificate of interest earned on savings and interest paid on loans at any time.
